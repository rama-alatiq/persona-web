    <p>I am proud to introduce the amazing people that make up the core of my life. My mother Dalal and father Kamal represent the heart of our family beliefs and have instilled in me a profound respect for compassion and solidarity. My oldest sister, Shrouq, is a towering figure of strength, and her mentoring has been crucial to my development. Bessan and Marah brighten our household with their varied viewpoints and kindness, adding to our shared experiences. Mohamed and Abdelrahman, the lively twins with endless vitality who are the youngest members of the family, symbolize the joy that comes from embracing life's wonders. Together, as a close-knit unit, we cherish one another's achievements and provide unwavering support. My family represents not just individuals but interconnected hearts, teaching me valuable lessons about love, resilience, and the importance of forging lasting connections.</p>
